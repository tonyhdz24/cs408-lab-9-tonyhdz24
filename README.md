# CS408 - M9 Lab: JavaScript Objects

## Overview

The overview of module 9's lab was to focus on improving our object-oriented programming skills in JavaScript. In this lab we expanded upon a basic bouncy ball demo by introducing user interaction through an evil circle that consumes the bouncing balls. This involved implementing a new Shape class from which both the balls and evil circle inherit from.

## How to run code

- To run the code open up your terminal and cd to the folder were you want to copy the repository to

  `cd path/to/your/directory`

- Once in the desired folder use the command git clone to copy the repo there

  `git clone https://github.com/tonyhdz24/cs408-lab-9-tonyhdz24`

- Then cd into the newly cloned repo

  ` cd cs408-lab-9-tonyhdz24`

- Once in the repo folder install any dependencies the repo requires  
   `npm install`

- Lastly open the cloned repo in your IDE open index.html and use Live Preview to view the webpage

  ` code .`
